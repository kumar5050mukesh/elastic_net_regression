    "# Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\"\"\"Elastic Net Regression is a regularized regression model that combines the L1 and L2 penalties of the Lasso and Ridge methods. \n",
    "This technique overcomes the limitations of both methods by learning from their shortcomings to improve the regularization of \n",
    "statistical models.\n",
    "Elastic Net is almost always preferred over Ridge or Lasso because it uses both the L2 and L1 penalties1. \n",
    "This allows for variable selection and regularization simultaneously\n",
    "Elastic Net regression is a regression technique that combines the features of both Ridge regression and Lasso regression.\n",
    " It is used for predicting a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Elastic Net regression and other regression techniques, such as Ridge regression and Lasso regression,\n",
    "is that Elastic Net regression uses both L1 and L2 regularization techniques. L1 regularization (used in Lasso regression) shrinks\n",
    "   the coefficients of less important variables to zero, thereby eliminating them from the model. L2 regularization \n",
    "   (used in Ridge regression) shrinks the coefficients of less important variables towards zero, but does not eliminate them completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net regression, on the other hand, combines the strengths of L1 and L2 regularization by adding a penalty term that \n",
    "is a weighted sum of the L1 and L2 norms of the regression coefficients. This allows for the selection of important variables \n",
    "while also handling the problem of multicollinearity among the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Elastic Net regression is a more flexible and powerful regression technique than Ridge and Lasso regression, \n",
